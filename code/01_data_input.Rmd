## Introduction

Text data comes in many different forms and shapes. It can be manually transcribed
by a researcher (worst-case scenario), extracted from PDF files, converted from
DOC/DOCX/ODT/RTF and other text formats, downloaded from an online API in JSON,
before it can be easily read in as a TXT file. In an ideal world we would only
deal with text data that has been already pre-processed for us and we just need
to load the respective CSV, RData or RDS file.

A few packages that we will be using for reading in the data:

```{r libraries}
library("pdftools")
library("stringr")
library("readtext")
library("quanteda")
library("tabulizer")
```

If you don't have them installed, do `install.packages("package_name")`.

## PDF/Online

We won't be working with the hardest case, where you would have to manually input
all your data, but although extremely tedious, it's relatively straight-forward
on the technical side. But let's try the second hardest case, PDF files downloaded
from an online source. An example here would be
*Draft Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union*,
published just a couple of weeks ago. It resides only [here](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf)
and an offline copy is available in the folder `data`. To parse the text layer
of the PDF file we will use the package `pdftools`. We will later see how it can
be done with `readtext`, which provides an interface to many more file formats.

```{r pdftools}
draft <- pdftools::pdf_text("../data/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf")
length(draft)
```

As you probably read in the news, the draft agreement is *585* pages long, so
`pdf_text` returns a 585-element character vector, where each element is raw
text from a page. Let's have a look at the first page:

```{r first_page}
first <- draft[1]
first
```

There are a few things to note. The text contains newline characters (`\n`) and
an uniformative `& /en 1` at the bottom of the page. To remove them we'll use
regular expressions in the base R (but check `stringr` package for newer implementation).
Regular expression deserve a session
their own, but we will limit our discussion to this example. Let's first remove
all whitespaces. We're using a class of characters `[[:space:]]` as a pattern
to replace, which refers to any kind of whitespace or invisible character.
More information on regular expresions in R is available
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html). `+`
at the end indicates that whitespace should occur one or more times.

```{r regex1}
first <- gsub("[[:space:]]+", " ", first)
first
```

Now, let's remove the page numbering. We're removing all numbers (`[0-9]`) that
occur between 1 and 3 times (`{1,3}`) and follow the string `& /en`.

```{r regex2}
first <- gsub("& /en [0-9]{1,3}", "", first)
first
```

This looks much better! Don't you agree? Let's now apply this strategy to all
pages in the document.

```{r all_pages}
draft <- gsub("[[:space:]]+", " ", draft)
draft <- gsub("& /en [0-9]{1,3}", "", draft)
draft[3]
```

## Challenge 1

**Easy mode** Now extract all the Directives mentioned in the Withdrawal Agreement. You can
either use `str_extract_all` function from `stringr` package. Otherwise,
use `gregexpr` function from base R and pass its output to `regmatches`.
The solution should be able to detect such directives as **Directive 92/84/EEC**,
**Directive 2011/64/EU** and **Directive 2008/118/EC**. We can then use the
extracted directives as a back-of-the-envelope 'topic model' to understand the
areas that the draft Withrawal Agreement concentrated on.

**Medium**: Compute a frequency table of directives mentioned and return
the first 10 and their corresponding frequencies. Also, show the total number of
cited directives.

**Advanced**: Produce a bar chart showing the frequencies of the
top 10 directives.

**Subject expert**: Explore the issues to which the most mentioned directives refer.

## Alternatives

### readtext

While `pdf_text` from `pdftools` works well with the PDF documents, `readtext`
offers a more versatile approach, allowing to pass different file formats,
including PDF (`pdftools` is still used in the backend).

```{r readtext}
draft <- readtext::readtext("../data/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf")
head(draft)
```

After Merging all of the pages together, `readtext` returns a 2-column data frame.
This approach is very useful for reading in a large number of documents, which
all have identical structure, and creating a corpus out of them.

```{r corpus}
draft_corpus <- quanteda::corpus(draft)
summary(draft_corpus)
draft_dfm <- quanteda::dfm(draft_corpus,
                           tolower = TRUE,
                           stem = FALSE,
                           remove_punct = TRUE)
summary(draft_dfm)
```

### tabulizer

On the other end of the spectrum, instead of lumping together all of the pages
from the entire document, you might want to extract just a part of a specific
page. The package `tabulizer` has a handy function `extract_text` that allows to
pass the interactively drawn area of a document and extract just this part.

For example, let's extract the first sections of Articles 4,6,7 (article 5 doesn't have any).
The pages for those articles are 11-15.

```{r tabulizer, eval = FALSE}
#  First we interactively locate areas that contain these sections
areas <- tabulizer::locate_areas("./data/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf",
                                 pages = seq(11,15))
```

```{r}
# Manually define areas as interactive mode isn't available when knitting 
areas <- list(
  c(top = 275.79010,
    left = 47.54186,
    bottom = 435.68968,
    right = 544.84421),
  NULL,
  c(top = 291.92675,
    left = 46.07489,
    bottom = 375.54396,
    right = 541.91028),
  c(top = 230.31407,
    left = 46.07489,
    bottom = 469.42995,
    right = 560.98087),
  c(top = 49.87693,
    left = 46.07489,
    bottom = 145.22989,
    right = 541.91028)
)
# Slightly convoluted setup needed to avoid pages with no areas defined
first_sections <- tabulizer::extract_text("../data/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf",
                                 pages = seq(11,15)[!unlist(lapply(areas, is.null))],
                                 area = `[`(areas, which(!unlist(lapply(areas, is.null)))))
first_sections
```
